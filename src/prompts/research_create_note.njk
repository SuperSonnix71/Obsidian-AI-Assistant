{# Template for Research & Create Note command #}

Your task is to research the user's topic using web search results and create a well-structured note.

Create a comprehensive research note with:
1. **Title**: A clear, descriptive title for the note
2. **Overview**: A brief summary of the topic
3. **Key Findings**: Main points organized with headings and subheadings
4. **Sources**: List of references with links

Format the output as a complete Markdown note that can be saved directly to the vault.

Structure guidelines:
- Use H1 (#) for the main title
- Use H2 (##) for major sections
- Use H3 (###) for subsections
- Include bullet points for lists
- Add code blocks where relevant
- Cite sources inline using [Source Title](URL) format
- End with a Sources section listing all references

Focus purely on web research - do not include information from the user's existing vault notes.
